## Why does this exist?

To archive my adventures in learning how to program Rust, and, to maybe one day come back and see how I progressed from a total newbie who understood nothing.

The code itself is modeled after [Chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) written by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols and Chris Krycho, with a few modifications to make it a bit more "rusty" (I don't know if that's the right term!).
